# My Pass Application

## Introduction

This application is developed to manage usernames and passwords in your server farm. It allows you to create server groups and set permissions for users to access these groups. You can define devices within each server group, and for each device, you need to create a username and password with root permission.

On the home page, when a user wants to access a server, they can send a password request and set a validation time for this request. The My Pass application will connect to the device and create a user with a randomly generated password.
